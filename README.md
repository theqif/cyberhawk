php, JS, XHR &amp; html implementation of FizzBuzz
NEED

 - PHP to build html-page, which has the UI & references JS (static html)
 - PHP to be called by XHR, generating a JSON array of 'inspection-data'
 - JS to fetch inspection-data & add to DOM

NOTES

 - bsns logic implemented in PHP.
 - output generation done in PHP
 - use jquery instead of vanilla XMLHttpRequest for speed/simplicity.  not necessarily an option in 'production'.


Our task

A wind turbine has 100 items on it, each gets inspected. Write an application that outputs numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print “Coating Damage” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Lightning Strike” instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “Coating Damage and Lightning Strike” instead of the number.
 
The code to generate the output should be done in PHP and the output should be rendered in HTML with a nice user experience. Share the code to us and show us what you can do.
 
Extra kudos for:
A nice UI that makes the most of the output
Pulling the inspection data down in an Ajax call and processing the results in the browser
Putting the code in GitHub for us to see
Getting it to run on a free AWS instance
Sharing your plan and approach (any notes you made before coding started)
Any future plans for how the application could be improved


Once you’ve done the task please email recruitment@thecyberhawk.com  with your output (ideally a link to where your code is stored and a link to where your code is running).
